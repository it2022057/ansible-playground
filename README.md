# Ansible Playground 

This repository contains an Ansible-based automation environment for deploying a complete multi-component application stack on remote Microsoft Azure VMs. Specifically, the components are the following:

* Spring Boot Application (main app)
* Database (MariaDB)
* Mailhog (Mail testing SMTP server)
* MinIO (object storage)

## Project set up
* create an inventory file (e.g. hosts or hosts.yaml) that holds the remote hosts that ansible will handle.
* Example entry is
```yaml
webserver: # <-- group
  hosts: # <-- List of hosts in group
    gcloud_host: # <-- host number 1 in group
      ansible_host: "your_public_ip"
      ansible_port: "your_port"
      ansible_ssh_user: "your_user"
    app01:  # <-- host number 2 in group
      ansible_host: server01
    app02:  # <-- host number 3 in group
      ansible_host: server02
  vars:  # <-- common variables in this group
    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

* to test if all hosts are accesible, run
```bash
ansible -m ping all
```
* to test if a group of hosts are accesible, run
```bash
ansible -m ping all <group-name>
```

## Install Ansible

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

## Clone project

With https (keep in mind it will ask for credentials because it is a private repository)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/it2022057/ansible-playground.git
```
or with ssh key (if you have one)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:it2022057/ansible-playground.git
```

## How to run

* All the components of the system
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/setup_all.yaml 
```

* Only the mariaDB deployment
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/mariaDB.yaml
```

* Only the main app deployment (i put a limit to deploy only in one azure vm, but if you want remove it)
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/spring.yaml -l devops-vm-2
```

* Only the mailhog deployment (i put a limit to deploy only in one azure vm, but if you want remove it)
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/mailhog.yaml -l devops-vm-2
```

* Only the minio deployment (i put a limit to deploy only in one azure vm, but if you want remove it)
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/minIO.yaml -l devops-vm-2
```


## Public Ip's

### If everything ran successfully, go to the public ip your vm servers have and then check for the results!!! For my project go to:

* db-server
```bash
http://4.223.107.0
```

* devops-vm-1 with all the rest of the components (except db)
```bash
http://135.225.114.238
```

* devops-vm-2 with all the rest of the components (except db)
```bash
http://20.234.5.108
```


## Vagrant guide for deploying local vms
* Vagrant install https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads 

### Plugins in order to run more efficiently your local vms

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
vagrant plugin list
vagrant plugin update
```

* For arch based linux distro 
```bash
VAGRANT_DISABLE_STRICT_DEPENDENCY_ENFORCEMENT=1 vagrant plugin install hostmanager
```

* If you want to make a Vagrantfile with an ububtu 22.04 box, run

```bash
vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64
```

* To deploy the vms run
```bash
vagrant up
```
or
```bash
vagrant up <name> 
```

* To see the vms (we must be in the directory where the Vagrantfile is)
```bash
vagrant status
```

* To ssh in a vagrant vm
```bash
vagrant ssh <vm-name>
```

* In order to stop the vagrant vms, run
```bash
vagrant halt
```
